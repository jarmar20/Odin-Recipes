    <h1>Jared's Famous Club Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="recipes/sandwich.webp" alt="Delicious Club Sandwich">
    <h2>Welcome to the Club</h2>
    <p>I concocted this recipe in my younger years as a starving young lad. I always had an affinity for french bread, melted cheese and delectable meats. This sandwich is certainly not your ordinary club. Upon your first bite, you will be transported to a world filled with some of the finest pleasures known to man...and yes, I'm still talking about the club. It's just that <em>good</em>!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>French Bread Loaf</li>
        <li>Deli ham</li>
        <li>Sliced American Cheese</li>
        <li>Block of Chedder Cheese</li>
        <li>Head of Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Green and Red Bell Pepper</li>
        <li>Green Goddess Dressing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the desired size of the french bread for sandwich and then cut in half</li>
        <li>Toast the bread lightly /(get a light browning/)</li>
        <li>Slice the tomoato, bell peppers thinly. Chop lettuce</li>
        <li>Cut 1//4 inch slices of the Chedder Cheese</li>
        <li>Layer the toasted bread with combination of half the sliced American Cheese and sliced Chedder Cheese</li>
        <li>Place the toast with the cheese into the toaster oven on broil for a couple of minutes. Allow for the cheese to melt and start to brown</li>
        <li>While the cheese and toast broil, assemble the lettuce, tomato, peppers and ham. Staggering the stacking between them.</li>
        <li>Once the toast is done, remove from the oven and spread goddess dressing on one side then place the sandwich contents into the toast</li>
        <li>Take the remaining cheese and place in the middle of the sandwich. It should be cold or room temperature.<li>
        <li>Serve. Tastes best when eaten soon after the bread is removed from oven. Cheese should pull apart seductively.</li>
    </ol>
